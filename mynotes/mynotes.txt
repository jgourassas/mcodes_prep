=== Some Notes on Structure Of Codes===============
--- ICD-10-CM STRUCTURE (copied from Coding Review. Patricia Schnering..)--
 There are 3–7 digits;
    Digit 1 is alpha;
    Digit 2 is numeric;
    Digits 3–7 are alpha or numeric
     (alpha characters are not case sensitive);
     and a decimal is used after the third character


Excludes 1
  Indicates that the code excluded should never be used with the code
  where the note is located (do not report both codes)
  Example:
    Q03 – Congenital hydrocephalus.
       Excludes 1: Acquired hydrocephalus (G91.-). 

Excludes 2
  Indicates that the condition excluded is not part of the condition represented by the
  code, but a patient may have both conditions at the same time, in which case both
  codes may be assigned together (both codes can be reported to capture both
  conditions)
   Example:
      L27.2 – Dermatitis due to ingested food.
      Excludes 2: Dermatitis due to food in contact with skin (L23.6, L24.6, L25.4). 

--- ICD-10-PCS STRUCTURE

    Has a seven-character, alphanumeric code structure.
    Each character contains up to 34 possible values.
    Each value represents a specific option for the general character definition
    (e.g., stomach is one of the values for the body part character).
    The ten digits 0–9 and the 24 letters A–H, J–N, and P–Z may be used in each character.
    The letters O and I are not used in order to avoid confusion with the digits 0 and 1.

   Sections: Indentify the general type of procedure
                 0 Medical and Surgical
                 1 Obstetrics
                 ............
                 H Subtance Abuse Treatment

   The second through seventh characters mean the same thing within each section,
   but may mean different things in other sections.
   In all sections, the third character specifies the general type of procedure performed
   (e.g., resection, transfusion, fluoroscopy), while the other characters give
   additional information such as the body part and approach.
   In ICD-10-PCS, the term “procedure” refers to the complete specification of the seven characters. 

 An Example

  Character Specification of the Medical and Surgical Section of ICD-10-PCS

  0DBJ3ZZ = Excision of Appendix, Percutaneous Approach

  Character General Meaning  In code 0DBJ3ZZ          Meaning for code 0DBJ3ZZ 

  First     Section          0                        Medical and Surgical
  Second    Body System      D                        Gastrointestinal 
  Third     Root Operation   B                        Excision 
  Fourth    Body Part        J                        Appendix 
  Fifth     Approach         3                        Percutaneous Approach 
  Sixth     Device           Z                        No Device 
  Seventh   Qualifier        Z                        No Qualifier
