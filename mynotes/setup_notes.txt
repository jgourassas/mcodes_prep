N.B.
ICD-10-CM, PCS is available from the CDC FTP server
There are comming: 
1. As structured XML data format 
2. As PDF for viewing. 
3. As  fixed width text format that includes primarily just the codes and titles from the tabular part
   of ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS
   
There is not a database version, but the fixed width description order files could be readily loaded into a database system.

*In this Software The XML files were used for ICD-10-CM 
              (As alternative you can use the Fixed format)
*The fixed format was used for ICD-10-PCS
